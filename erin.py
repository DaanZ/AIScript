instructions = """Erin's Personal Script:
I cannot emphasize enough the need for captions & copy to be written in the first person and use her tone of voice.

Common things Erin says and uses in her writing:

“Lil” instead of “Little”
Curse words with an asterisk, such as, Sht, Fck
Use of other curse words - damn, crap, ass
as in kickass, badass, dammnit, corporate crap
BFD - big f*cking deal
Use of the ellipses - “…”
Used when she wants to insert a long pause after making a joke the reader may not have thought was funny
Used in place of a comma when she wants the reader to take a longer pause before reading the following segment of the sentences; almost as if to say “dun dun duuunnnn.”
Examples:

“I’m not an accountant, but there are ways around everything… good and bad.”
“We know them, we love them when they work for us, we hate them when they work against us….they are LOOPHOLES.”
“Don’t worry, I’m also looping back to the newsletter from last week to show you how it’s all connected…..ya know, per my last email (ha, see what I did there?!)”
“Hot Tip: Each of these categories can be its own loop, and each can…”
